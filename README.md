# about project
This project was made by [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks). We used `npx create-next-app` and [React 18](https://react.dev/).
We used modern technologies such as [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), React Function Components, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/).
We prefer using React Context instead of [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for readability and easy using.

The multiple game is the only available game.
